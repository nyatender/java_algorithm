Q25. What is Java String Pool?
Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory.
In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not.
If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created
in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.

Q27. What is constructor chaining in Java?
In Java, constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another with respect to the current object.
 Constructor chaining is possible only through legacy where a subclass constructor is responsible for invoking the
 superclass’ constructor first. There could be any number of classes in the constructor chain. Constructor chaining can
 be achieved in two ways:

Within the same class using this()
From base class using super()

Q29. What is a classloader in Java?
The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files.
Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. Java provides three built-in classloaders:

Bootstrap ClassLoader
Extension ClassLoader
System/Application ClassLoader

Q32. What is a Map in Java?
Map doesn’t contain duplicate keys.
Each key can map at max one value.

OOPS:
Q15. What is a marker interface?
A Marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data member and member functions.
In simpler terms, an empty interface is called the Marker interface. The most common examples of Marker interface in
Java are Serializable, Cloneable etc. The marker interface can be declared as follows.

public interface Serializable{
}

Q17. What is a copy constructor in Java?
Copy constructor is a member function that is used to initialize an object using another object of the same class.
Though there is no need for copy constructor in Java since all objects are passed by reference. Moreover,
Java does not even support automatic pass-by-value.

Ques: Why hashtable don't allow null keys.
On the other hand Hashtable does not allow null keys. This is because the objects used as keys in a Hashtable
implements the hashCode() and equals() methods for their storage and retrieval.
Since null is not an object it cannot implement the methods. If you try hashing a null key, it will throw a NullPointerException .

Ques: HashSet vs TreeSet
HashSet -> Can able to store null objects
TreeSet -> Couldn’t store null objects

Q #32) What are the types of Exceptions?

Answer: There are two types of Exceptions. They are explained below in detail.
a) Checked Exception:
These exceptions are checked by the compiler at the time of compilation. Classes that extend Throwable class except
Runtime exception and Error are called checked Exception. Checked Exceptions must either declare the exception using
throws keyword (or) surrounded by appropriate try/catch.For Example, ClassNotFound Exception

b) Unchecked Exception:
These exceptions are not checked during the compile time by the compiler.  The compiler doesn’t force to handle these exceptions.
 It includes:
Arithmetic Exception
ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception

Ques: Exceptions
try, catch, finally-> for code clean-up(must fall in it)

Q #41) What does the yield method of the Thread class do?
Answer: A yield () method moves the currently running thread to a runnable state and allows the other threads for execution.
So that equal priority threads have a chance to run. It is a static method. It doesn’t release any lock.
Yield () method moves the thread back to the Runnable state only, and not the thread to sleep (), wait () (or) block.

Q #53) Which methods are used during the Serialization and Deserialization process?
Answer: ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream classes are higher level java.io.package.
We will use them with lower level classes FileOutputStream and FileInputStream.

Qus:
Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/
Ques: String, String builder, StringBuffer
StringBuilder: J2SE 5 adds a new string class to Java’s already powerful string handling capabilities.
This new class is called StringBuilder. It is identical to StringBuffer except for one important difference:
it is not synchronized, which means that it is not thread-safe.
