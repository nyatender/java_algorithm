At least you should know that :
1) Two unequal objects may return the same hashcode.
2) When two objects are equal by equals(), they must have the same hashcode.

->poll() vs remove() method of Queue interface
  If Queue is empty() then a call to remove() method will throw Exception
  while a call to poll() method returns null.

->Fail-fast iterator traverse over original collection class while fail-safe iterator
  traverse over a copy or view of original collection.
->Iterator returned by synchronized Collection are fail-fast while iterator
  returned by concurrent collections are fail-safe in Java.
->only Concurrent Collections introduced in JDK 1.5 e.g. CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet supports fail safe Iteration.

->Map to create it's synchronized version by using Collections.synchronizedMap() method
->By default ConcurrentHashMap simultaneously allows 16 threads to read and write from Map without any external synchronization.
->The synchronized collections classes, Hashtable, and Vector, and the synchronized wrapper classes, Collections.synchronizedMap()
   and Collections.synchronizedList(), provide a basic conditionally thread-safe implementation of Map and List.
-> ConcurrentHashMap introduced the concept of segmentation
->ConcurrentHashMap does not allow null keys or null values while synchronized HashMap allows one null key.

->Iterator also allows you to remove elements from collection during traversal but Enumeration doesn't allow that,
  it doesn't got the remove() method.
->Enumeration is also a legacy class and not all Collection supports it e.g. Vector supports Enumeration but ArrayList doesn't.
->functionality of Enumeration interface is duplicated by the Iterator interface.
->Also Iterator is more secure and safe as compared to Enumeration because it  does not allow other thread to modify
 the collection object while some thread is iterating over it and throws ConcurrentModificationException.
 This is by far most important fact for me for deciding between Iterator vs Enumeration in Java.

->TreeMap, which sorts elements in natural order doesn't allow null keys because compareTo() method throws NullPointerException if compared with null.

== is an operator and equals() is method.
== operator compares reference or memory location of objects in the heap, whether they point to the same location or not.
When we talk about equals() method the main purpose is to compare the state of two objects or contents of the object.
But there is one relation between this two is default implementation of equals() method work like == means it will check
the memory reference of the object if they point to the same location then two objects are equals and it is defined in Object class.
