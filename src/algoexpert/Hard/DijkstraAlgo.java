Dijkstra's Algorithm
You're given an integer start and a list edges of pairs of integers.
The list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph. The number of
vertices in the graph is equal to the length of edges , where each index i in
edges contains vertex i 's outbound edges, in no particular order. Each
individual edge is represented by an pair of two numbers,
[destination, distance] , where the destination is a positive integer
denoting the destination vertex and the distance is a positive integer representing
the length of the edge (the distance from vertex i to vertex destination ).
Note that these edges are directed, meaning that you can only travel from a
particular vertex to its destinationâ€”not the other way around (unless the
destination vertex itself has an outbound edge to the original vertex).
Write a function that computes the lengths of the shortest paths between
start and all of the other vertices in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm and
returns them in an array. Each index i in the output array should represent the
length of the shortest path between start and vertex i . If no path is found
from start to vertex i , then output[i] should be -1 .
Note that the graph represented by edges won't contain any self-loops (vertices
that have an outbound edge to themselves) and will only have positively weighted
edges (i.e., no negative distances).
If you're unfamiliar with Dijkstra's algorithm, we recommend watching the
Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting
to code.
