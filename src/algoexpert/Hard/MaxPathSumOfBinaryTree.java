Max Path Sum In Binary Tree
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum.
A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is
connected to more than two other nodes; a path sum is the sum of the
values of the nodes in a particular path.
Each BinaryTree node has an integer value , a left child node, and
a right child node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes
themselves or None / null .
Sample Input
tree =     1
         /   \
        2     3
       / \   / \
      4   5 6   7
Sample Output
18 // 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 7
